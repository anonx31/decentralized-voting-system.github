Welcome to the Decentralized Voting System project! This repository contains the source code for a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system built on blockchain technology.

Key Features:
Security: Ensures voter anonymity and data integrity.
Transparency: All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Tamper-Proof: Immutable records prevent vote manipulation.
Decentralized: Eliminates the need for a central authority.

Technologies Used:
Blockchain: Ethereum/Solidity
Smart Contracts: Handle voting logic and storage
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js/Express
Database: IPFS for decentralized storage
