# Decentralized Voting System Using Blockchain

Welcome to the Decentralized Voting System project! This repository contains the source code for a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system built on blockchain technology.


## Key Feature
- Security: Ensures voter anonymity and data integrity.
- Transparency: All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
- Tamper-Proof: Immutable records prevent vote manipulation.
- Decentralized: Eliminates the need for a central authority.

## Technologies Used:
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Solidity
- Smart Contracts: Handle voting logic and storage
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: IPFS for decentralized storage
